# Scientific Self-Determination (SSD) Project FAQ

## Mission of the Organization
The Scientific Self-Determination project is a non-profit effort focused on educating and empowering local communities to engage in political decision-making. Our mission is to **simulate, educate, and act** — providing citizens with clear, visual tools to better understand governance systems and increase their consent in government processes.

---

## End Deliverables of the Project
For the Version 2 capstone project, the final outputs will include:

1. **A hosted Flask web application** on PythonAnywhere.
2. **At least three core visualizations (MVP):**
   - Collaborative Veto
   - Multi-choice Voting
   - Supreme Court Veto (26 states threshold)
3. **Documentation** explaining:
   - Voting models and concepts
   - How to run and contribute to the project
   - Updated definitions and contextual information for public understanding
4. **Stretch Goal (Phase 2):**
   - Minimum Amount of Space Allocation visualization (D3.js)

## Who is This Project For?
- **Primary audience:** The general public, especially citizens who want to understand alternative governance systems.
- **Secondary audience:** Non-profit staff and volunteers who will use this site to educate communities.
- **Academic audience:** Our university peers and faculty evaluating the capstone project.

## Project Hosting and Costs
- Hosted on **PythonAnywhere**, which natively supports Flask.
- A domain name will be purchased, but **only after the planning and MVP phases are completed**.
- Costs for hosting and domain will be covered by the institute (non-profit).

## Company Culture
The project team is currently in a **start-up/seeding phase**:
- High power distance (roles and leadership are recognized)
- Flexible tolerance for change
- Masculine and individualistic orientation
- Restrictive in scope (we aim to focus on achievable goals)

This culture may shift as the project grows beyond the initial academic phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is this project solving?**  
A: We’re not selling a product — we’re building a civic education platform. The site is a **public resource** to inform and simulate governance models, helping citizens think critically and act in their communities.

**Q: What are the deliverables for the capstone?**  
A: A live Flask web app with three MVP visualizations, clear documentation, and a pathway for stretch goals.

**Q: Where can I find technical details?**  
A:  
- **README.md** in the repository: project overview.  
- **/docs folder**: expanded documentation and definitions.  
- **Dev Materials folder (GitHub)**: technical notes, references, and datasets.  

**Q: Who is maintaining this project?**  
A: Currently the capstone team (“Team JAST”), with Thom Mondeaux as the non-profit liaison. Post-capstone, the non-profit will maintain the repository.

**Q: What technologies are we using?**  
A: Flask (Python), Plotly (for MVP visualizations), D3.js (stretch goal), Git/GitHub (version control), and PythonAnywhere (hosting).

**Q: What if I have a question not answered here?**  
A: First check the README.md and docs folder. If still unclear, raise the question in our **Teams chat** or GitHub Issues — most questions will be answered within 24 hours

## The End Result of the Project
- A publicly accessible, hosted Flask site.  
- Clear, accessible explanations of voting and governance concepts.  
- Interactive (or static) visualizations that illustrate Collaborative Veto, Multi-choice Voting, and Supreme Court Veto.  
- Documentation that allows the public, the non-profit, and future developers to use and extend the project.  

## Where to Look for Answers
- **Repository README.md** → quick overview and instructions.  
- **Docs folder** → extended documentation for concepts, governance definitions, and technical setup.  
- **GitHub Issues / Teams chat** → live discussions, blockers, and clarifications.
