### User Stores and Critial Success Factors

# User Stories Examples

## Users: General Public

- As a citizen, I want to visit the site and read clear, updated definitions of governance models so that I understand concepts like “collaborative veto”, “multiple choice voting”, and “supreme court veto”.  
- As a citizen, I want to view a Plotly bar chart showing candidate approval totals under multiple choice voting so that I can compare how many citizens support each candidate.  
- As a citizen, I want to see a US state-level choropleth map with states proportionally colored based on whether 26 or more object to a supreme court veto, so that I can visually see if the veto threshold is met.  
- As a citizen, I want to see a county-level map for West Virginia showing which counties would veto a state law, so I can understand local regional variation.  

## Users: Non-Profit / Admin

- As a non-profit admin, I want the documentation content to be reorganized and rewritten with updated examples so that educational materials are clearer and more engaging.  
- As a non-profit admin, I want the site to load quickly and host these visualizations statically so that users with moderate connections see them without slowdown.  

## Users: Developers / Team

- As a developer, I want the repository to include sample GeoJSON or shapefile data for states and counties so that I can build and test visualizations without hunting for data.  
- As a developer, I want new visualization code to be modular (e.g. each viz in its own file or module) so that it's easier to maintain and potentially reuse.  
- As a developer, I want clear documentation in the docs folder that explains how to run the Flask app, add new visualizations, and update data so that future contributors can work confidently.
