### Expanded Discussion Summary
- Pratibha clarified expectations for the prototype: focus on communicating the idea clearly and iterating quickly rather than meeting a specific UI/UX tool or fidelity standard.  
- The team discussed prototyping options; paper prototyping was recommended because it is fast, highly iterable, and sufficient to convey core flows and interactions.  
- Pratibha noted that higher-fidelity work is valuable only if someone intends to add UI/UX tool experience to their resume; otherwise keep it lightweight.  
- Participants agreed Pratibha’s line of questioning provided useful insights about scope and priorities, and that those clarifications reduced ambiguity about deliverables.

### Key Decisions
- **Prototype fidelity**: Prioritize speed and clarity; low-fidelity prototypes such as paper sketches are acceptable and recommended.  
- **Video deliverable**: Deprioritize producing a meeting video; use time instead for prototyping and data collection unless a video is explicitly requested later.  
- **Communication fallback**: Use meeting chat for questions and clarifications when audio is unreliable.

### Action Items with Suggested Owners and Deadlines
1. **Begin prototype sketches** — Create initial low-fidelity flows and screens (paper or simple digital mockups). **Owner:** Team members; 
2. **Collect and log prototype data** — Identify required user or test data, collect initial samples, and store them in the shared repo or designated folder. **Owner:** Data lead or rotating volunteers; 
3. **Document prototype decisions** — Capture assumptions, user flows, and any constraints so future team members can pick up work. **Owner:** Whoever builds the first prototype; **Suggested deadline:** With initial prototype deliverable.  
4. **Post open questions in chat** — Use chat for unresolved questions and track answers for transparency. **Owner:** All participants; **Ongoing.**  
5. **Assign specific feature owners and timelines** — Confirm who owns each prototype feature and set short milestones for iteration. **Owner:** Team lead or coordinator; 
6. **Plan next sync or check-in** — Schedule a brief stand-up or review to show initial sketches and collected data. **Owner:** Team lead;

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Lack of clear owners or deadlines slows progress.  
  - **Mitigation:** Immediately assign owners for prototype pieces and set 3–7 day milestones.  
- **Risk:** Team over-invests in high-fidelity UI work unnecessarily.  
  - **Mitigation:** Reiterate that low-fidelity, expressive prototypes meet current goals unless an individual explicitly wants high-fidelity work for learning or portfolio purposes.
